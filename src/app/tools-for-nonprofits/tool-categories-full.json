The interface is clean, and it’s easy to share access with your accountant or treasurer. There’s also a non-profit discount available, which helps keep it affordable as your organization grows.\n\nOne of the strengths of Xero is its extensive integration capabilities. For instance, it connects with donor management tools like Keela and Infoodle, allowing you to sync donor data and streamline fundraising efforts. If your non-profit uses platforms like Stripe or PayPal for online donations, Xero can integrate with these to automatically record transactions, reducing manual data entry.\n\nThese integrations help non-profits automate routine tasks, maintain accurate records, and focus more on their mission rather than administrative work.",

You can host it yourself for free, or use the cloud version, and it works with hundreds of tools like Airtable, Google Sheets, Mailchimp, and CRMs. We've used it to automate newsletters, sync volunteer sign-up data, and even route HR requests into Kanban boards.\n\nIt’s not the best option if you're looking for a plug-and-play interface.
