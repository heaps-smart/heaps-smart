While there\u2019s no nonprofit discount at the moment, the free plan is still a solid starting point, especially if you\u2019re just getting into video content.\n\nOne of the reasons we prefer Vimeo over YouTube is the viewing experience. There are no ads, no distractions, and you have more control over how your videos are embedded and displayed on your website. This makes it a great choice for hosting things like campaign videos, project updates, training materials, or board inductions.\n\nYou can also password-protect videos or make them private, which is handy for internal comms, member-only content, or sharing updates with funders. If your team is starting to build a content library and wants a more polished home for video, Vimeo is a solid choice that keeps things professional and distraction-free.",

There\u2019s also a simple eSignature tool built in, which can be a quick solution for signing internal documents without needing a separate platform. If you're reviewing policies or writing grants as a group, the commenting and suggestion tools help keep everyone on the same page.\n\nDocs isn\u2019t flashy, but it does a lot quietly in the background. It\u2019s free with Google Workspace for Nonprofits and gives your team a shared space to work together without worrying about version control or who has the latest file.",

    "hs_recommended_details": "While we're not accountants, we believe Xero is a solid choice for non-profits that want to stay on top of their finances without a full-time bookkeeper. It\u2019s great for smaller teams because it simplifies tasks like tracking expenses, sending invoices, managing payroll, and reconciling bank accounts. The interface is clean, and it\u2019s easy to share access with your accountant or treasurer. There\u2019s also a non-profit discount available, which helps keep it affordable as your organization grows.\n\nOne of the strengths of Xero is its extensive integration capabilities. For instance, it connects with donor management tools like Keela and Infoodle, allowing you to sync donor data and streamline fundraising efforts. If your non-profit uses platforms like Stripe or PayPal for online donations, Xero can integrate with these to automatically record transactions, reducing manual data entry.\n\nThese integrations help non-profits automate routine tasks, maintain accurate records, and focus more on their mission rather than administrative work.",
