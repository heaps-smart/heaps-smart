But this collective intelligence was hard to access, buried across spreadsheets, paper records, Facebook posts, and memory. The community needed a way to connect with all this information quickly without needing to be technical.",

          <p>
            We built Cassie to be an always-on AI-powered teammate trained to understand cassowaries.<br /><br />Cassie helps users
            explore 30+ years of conservation insights using natural language. Ask her about movement patterns, habitat
            threats, known individuals, or historical interventions. She'll find and explain it. Built specifically for
            the Mission Beach Cassowaries team, Cassie makes local knowledge searchable, shareable, and useful.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            As part of the engagement, the internal team was upskilled in AI fundamentals, tools and workflows,
            empowering them to maintain and expand Cassie's brain over time.
