## Why Cost Matters in Community Mapping  

Geographic Information Systems ([GIS](/tools-for-nonprofits/?category=gis)) turn raw location data into clear, decision-ready maps that show patterns, need, and impact. Whether you are mapping cassowary habitat corridors, food insecurity hotspots, or community service coverage, the goal is the same: give your data geographic context so people can immediately see what is happeningâ€”and where.

For non-profits, budgets are often stretched thin. Every dollar saved on software is another dollar that can go towards planting trees, running community programmes, or funding staff time. Mapping does not have to be expensive. Today, powerful GIS tools are available at heavily discounted rates, or even free, for organisations working in social or environmental good.  

At Heaps Smart, we are focused on lowering the barrier to entry for non-profits who want to harness GIS for impact.

## ArcGIS: Discounts and Grants for Non-Profits  

[ArcGIS](/tools-for-nonprofits/arcgis/) is Esri's flagship suite of mapping and analysis tools, used by governments, universities, and businesses worldwide. It's used for everything from building maps and analysing data to creating interactive dashboards and digital stories. For non-profits, this means moving the ability to move beyond static maps at a fraction of the price.  

Esri's Nonprofit Program offers special pricing and packages for registered charities and NGOs. You'll get access to a suite of tools, each with a different purpose:  

- **ArcGIS Online**: A cloud-based hub where you create, store, and share web maps. Staff and volunteers can log in and collaborate in one space.  
- **ArcGIS Pro**: A full desktop GIS for advanced spatial analysis and map production. Perfect for tasks like overlaying habitat data with development zones.  
- **StoryMaps**: Combines maps, text, images, and video into interactive web stories. Great for grant reports, outreach, and donor engagement.  
- **Dashboards**: Turns raw data into interactive charts and maps in real time. Useful for tracking volunteer activity or tree planting progress.  
- **Hub Premium**: A public-facing engagement portal where people can sign up for initiatives, contribute data, or explore your projects.  
- **Training Resources**: Probably one of my favorite benefits: Access to Esri's e-Learning courses, tutorials, and community forums so staff and volunteers build GIS skills without extra cost.

Smaller organisations can sometimes also access the **Small Nonprofit Organisation Grant**, which provides these tools at no cost.  

**How to apply for an ArcGIS discount:**  
1. Confirm your charity or non-profit status in your country.  
2. Visit the [Esri Nonprofit Program page](https://www.esri.com/en-us/industries/nonprofit/nonprofit-program).
3. Submit your application with registration details, and explain how you will use GIS for impact.  

**Good to know:**  
- Discounts vary by country. In Australia, eligibility is managed by Esri Australia.  
- The process can take a few weeks, so apply early if you need GIS for a project or grant deadline.

## Choosing What's Right for Your Organisation

- Choose **[ArcGIS](/tools-for-nonprofits/arcgis/)** if you need enterprise stability, polished StoryMaps, or if your funders expect ArcGIS outputs.  
- Choose **[QGIS](/tools-for-nonprofits/qgis/)** if you want maximum flexibility, no ongoing costs, and you are comfortable with open-source support.  
- Use **both** if you want the best of both worlds. Many non-profits analyse in QGIS, then publish results in ArcGIS StoryMaps for public engagement.
