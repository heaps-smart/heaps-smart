**About**: Since 1990, the C4 community has been dedicated to preserving the natural wonders of Queensland’s Cassowary Coast, where the ancient Wet Tropics meet the Great Barrier Reef. Through community collaboration, education, and innovative action, C4 spearheads efforts to protect the endangered Southern Cassowary and its critical habitats.

**The work**: Heaps Smart collaborated with the C4 management team to replatform their legacy website, aiming to enhance awareness and understanding of C4’s mission. The revamped site focuses on educating the public about the endangered Southern Cassowary and fostering greater community involvement in local conservation initiatives.
