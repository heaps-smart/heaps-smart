“Artists work across all mediums. And increasingly, that includes digital platforms and technologies.” — Creative Australia, National Cultural Policy

Regional Australia is where creative ideas have room to breathe. Out here—where cassowaries roam, rain hammers down, and the satellite Wi-Fi battles bravely through the canopy—the word artist tends to evoke paintbrushes, a stage, or someone with a guitar at the pub. It doesn’t always conjure us: a team of designers, developers and strategists, headphones on, deep in flow at our home studio or dialled in at a local café, headphones on, minds alive with the rhythm of invention. 

We are Heaps Smart. A creative technology company born of individuals from the “big city” who have nested quietly in the jungle, where ideas (and people) have the space to grow wild.

While our tools may look different, we are artists. We build with pixels, structure with logic, compose with insight. We craft—just not with clay or paint. The UNESCO 2022 Creative Economy Report recognises digital creativity—including design, UX, software development, and digital storytelling—as part of the broader cultural and creative industries. So why is it so difficult to embrace our kind of art into the creative community?

Like most artists, we don’t charge by the hour because you can’t measure creativity in minutes. You measure it in moments—the “aha” ones, the “oh, wow” and the “what if” ones, the deep sighs when something finally comes together after wrestling with it for days. You measure it in outcomes. In impact. In beauty that works. The creative process is at our core: We think deeply, we imagine widely, and we build what didn’t exist before.

When our designers map out a journey through a digital landscape, when our developers make a button feel right, when our strategists pull the golden thread from tangled mission statements to find clarity—that is the work of creatives. It’s intuitive. It’s intentional. It’s emotional. And yes, it's technical. But creativity and technology have never been at odds—they've always been co-conspirators.

So next time you think of creatives, picture us too.

The ones sketching interfaces in notebooks.  
The ones crafting taglines like spells.  
The ones building logic into art.  
The ones shaping pixels into purpose.  

We’re not just here to upload photos to your website (though we can do that). We’re here to dream alongside you. To build digital things that feel human.

We are Creatives.  
Our medium is Digital.  

And yeah… sometimes we fix the wifi.
