**About**: The Dyrt is a leading platform dedicated to helping outdoor enthusiasts discover and enjoy camping in The Great Outdoors. Founded with the mission to simplify the camping experience, The Dyrt can be thought of as the Airbnb of camping. The mobile and web application provides comprehensive campground discovery, user-generated reviews, photos, and essential information for campers and campground owners alike

**The Work**: As the Director of Mobile Development at The Dyrt, I lead a team building a user-centric mobile and web platform designed to enhance the camping experience. Before The Dyrt, campers often struggled to find reliable, up-to-date information about campgrounds and their amenities. Many existing resources were outdated or incomplete, making trip planning cumbersome. 
The Dyrt aimed to solve these issues by providing a comprehensive, user-friendly platform where campers could easily discover and review campgrounds, and campground owners could showcase their sites and connect with potential visitors.


### The Impact

#### For campers:
- Enhanced campground discovery: Quickly finding suitable campgrounds with detailed filters and search options.
- Informed travel decisions: Making better choices with user reviews and photos.
- Streamlined trip planning: Simplifying bookings with trip planning tools and real-time availability updates.


#### For campground owners:
* Increased visibility with campers: Boosting exposure to a broad audience of campers.
* Control of their listings: Allowing owners to manage campground listings, respond to reviews, and update information.
* Valuable guest insights: Providing feedback and preferences to help improve offerings and attract more guests.
