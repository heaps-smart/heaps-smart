## Privacy Check: Are Your Systems Up to Date?  

Last October, the Australian Privacy Act had its biggest shake-up in decades. If your organisation collects personal data from donors, members, volunteers or program participants, it's time for a system check.  

This isn't just about ticking legal boxes. It's about building trust, running tighter operations, and protecting the people who make your mission possible.  

Here's a quick refresher on what changed, and a checklist to make sure your organisation is keeping pace.

## What Changed in Late 2024?  

The Privacy Act reform introduced stronger obligations for how organisations collect, store and use personal data, with a clear focus on transparency, control and security.  

#### **Key changes include:**  

**Stronger rights for individuals**  
Australians can now request to access, correct, or delete their personal information. They can also object to how it's used, especially for profiling or automated decisions.  

**Clear and specific consent**  
It's no longer enough to have a vague privacy policy buried in your website footer. You need to be upfront about what data you're collecting, why you're collecting it, and who else might see it. Consent must be informed, freely given, and easy to withdraw.  

**Accountability for third-party tools**  
If you're using apps, cloud platforms, or other digital services that handle personal data, you're responsible for managing the risks. Passing the blame after a breach is no longer acceptable. You need to show you've done due diligence and put safeguards in place.  

**The rules cover more organisations**  
Even if you're a smaller non-profit under the $3 million revenue threshold, you may still need to comply if you handle sensitive data such as health information, children's details, or services aimed at vulnerable communities.  

**Fairness and transparency**  
Any data collection must now be “fair and reasonable” for your purpose. Collecting more data than you need, or using it in unexpected ways, could put you at risk of non-compliance.
