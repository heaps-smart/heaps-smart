## Checklist: Improve Your Organisation's AI-Visibility and Messaging  

AI tools are becoming a first point of contact between organisations and the public. A funder, volunteer, or journalist may learn about your work through an AI-generated summary before visiting your website. This checklist highlights practical steps to improve how your organisation is surfaced and represented.  

### Crawlability  
<input type="checkbox" id="robots-txt"> <label for="robots-txt">Have we ensured public pages aren't blocked in `robots.txt`?</label>  
<input type="checkbox" id="ai-crawlers"> <label for="ai-crawlers">Have we allowed AI crawlers (GPTBot, CCBot, Google-Extended) if we want to be discoverable?</label>  

### Structured Data  
<input type="checkbox" id="schema"> <label for="schema">Have we added `schema.org` markup for events, projects, people, and donation buttons?</label>  
<input type="checkbox" id="metadata"> <label for="metadata">Are our headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`) and metadata (titles, descriptions) clear and accurate?</label>  

### Content Format  
<input type="checkbox" id="plain-html"> <label for="plain-html">Is key information published in plain HTML, not locked in PDFs or images?</label>  
<input type="checkbox" id="pdf-summary"> <label for="pdf-summary">If PDFs are necessary, do we provide an HTML summary alongside?</label>  
<input type="checkbox" id="text-not-graphics"> <label for="text-not-graphics">Is important text written as text rather than embedded in graphics?</label>  

### Multiple Registers  
<input type="checkbox" id="technical-plain"> <label for="technical-plain">Do we use both technical terms and plain-language alternatives (e.g. "catchment rehabilitation" and "river restoration")?</label>  
<input type="checkbox" id="query-coverage"> <label for="query-coverage">Are we making it easier for AIs to connect our work to different types of queries?</label>  

### Freshness & Consistency  
<input type="checkbox" id="updates"> <label for="updates">Do we update our site regularly so content doesn't go stale?</label>  
<input type="checkbox" id="consistent-messaging"> <label for="consistent-messaging">Is our mission and impact worded consistently across our website, social media, and reports?</label>  

### Links & Networks  
<input type="checkbox" id="outbound-links"> <label for="outbound-links">Have we added outbound links to credible partners and funders?</label>  
<input type="checkbox" id="inbound-links"> <label for="inbound-links">Are collaborators and media linking back to our site to strengthen discoverability?</label>  

### Regular Audits  
<input type="checkbox" id="llm-audit"> <label for="llm-audit">Do we regularly ask ChatGPT, Gemini, or Perplexity: "What is [Our Org]?"</label>  
<input type="checkbox" id="audit-fix"> <label for="audit-fix">Do we track what's missing, distorted, or outdated â€” and use that as our fix-it list?</label>

**Bottom line:** If your site is crawlable, structured, clear, and consistent, AI systems are far more likely to represent your organisation accurately. From there, map the gaps into an action plan: do you need to publish more structured content, refine your messaging, or remove outdated material?
