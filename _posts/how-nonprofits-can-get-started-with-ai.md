AI is moving quickly. There are new tools, new models, and, naturally, new concerns about safety and impact. For many non-profits, the challenge isn't whether to engage with AI, but how to do it in a way that's thoughtful, secure, and at a pace that supports your team.

Like most innovation, you don't need to have all the answers to get started. You can explore small, safe experiments that build confidence and initiate useful conversations with your team. 

AI can be a powerful tool for engagement, creativity, and productivity, and the advice I can give is: just start.

## 1. Start with a problem, not a tool.

AI works best when it helps solve a real problem you're already facing. Instead of focusing on a new tool or a complicated workflow, think about a task that takes up your time or energy.

Here are a few examples:
- Writing the first draft of a grant application
- Summarising a long meeting
- Coming up with ideas for social media
- Turning rough notes into a clear email

Choose one task that feels repetitive or slow and start there.

## 2. Try a simple tool first.

To get a feel for how AI works, start with a tool designed to help with everyday writing and thinking.

Two we suggest:
- **[ChatGPT](/tools-for-nonprofits/chatgpt)**
- **[Gemini](/tools-for-nonprofits/google-gemini)**

These are free to use, and very good at helping with writing, summarising, brainstorming and editing. You can think of them as helpful writing assistants. Jump right in and ask anything.

For example, you could say:
> "Can you help me write a thank-you message to our monthly donors?"

You'll need to check and edit the results, but these tools can save you a lot of time getting started.

## 3. Experiment with AI features in tools you already use.

Most of the tools you already use will have built some AI-features that you can now experiment with. They will be attempting to solve a problem with AI that they have identified, this can be a great place to experiment, (and provide feedback!). 

For example:
- **Canva** has AI tools that help write text, clean up designs, or create quick drafts
- **Gmail** can help you reply to emails faster with smart suggestions
- **Google Docs** has a built-in "Help me write" feature powered by AI
- **Google Meet & Zoom** can help with meeting notes and summaries

## 4. Prompt like a pro.

As you get more confident interacting with AI, you may wish to hone your prompting skills. AI tools work best when you give them clear instructions. They don't always know what you want unless you say it.

Instead of asking:
> "Write a report"

Try something like:
> "Write a 200-word update for our board members about our recent tree planting event. Make it friendly, clear, and written like a newsletter."

There are loads of prompt libraries and prompting micro-courses online to help you get even better. The better your prompt, the better the results.

## 5. Do it together.

Once you've had a few small wins, consider sharing what worked with your team. You might find that others on your team are curious to learn alongside you.

Start simple:
- Try using AI to plan your next newsletter together
- Use it to shorten a long document into dot points
- Or draft a job ad and see how much time it saves

Learning together helps your team grow more confident. It can give new people a chance to lead and find creative ways to solve problems.

## 6. Humans in the loop.

Invite your AI-curious team to draft the ground rules together. Start by reading up on the risks: privacy, accuracy, and bias. List the moments where AI can help, the data it can and cannot see, and the people who will double-check every result. Having the whole team shape these rules builds shared understanding and confidence, even if you do not have an in-house IT or risk specialist.

A simple one-pager is enough to start:
- **When to use AI** – tasks such as first-draft writing or meeting notes
- **What stays private** – supporter data, volunteer data, salaries, sensitive case details
- **Who checks the output** – name the person or role that gives final approval

Once those basics are clear, you will be ready to explore larger workflows or custom AI tools. When that day comes, give us a call and we will lend a hand.

## Stay curious.

You don't need to overhaul your whole workflow to adopt and see the benefits of AI.

Just pick one task.
Try one tool.
Share your experience.
